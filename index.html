    <h2>Welcome to our Interactive Solar Eclipse Analysis!</h2>
    <p>Here, you'll discover an engaging way to explore the April 8th, 2024 Solar Eclipse,
        which captivated many across the United States.
       Let's begin by understanding what a solar eclipse entails.
        According to NASA, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves
        between Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow that obscures the
        Sun for observers on Earth's surface for a short period of time.
        It's the shadow of the moon that produces the mesmerizing solar eclipse effect.<br><br>
       Have you ever tried to block the sun with your thumb? Well,
        imagine the moon as a much larger version of your thumb in
        this scenario.<br>
       The aim of this analysis is to embark on a journey of discovery
        using data obtained from this event, uncovering insights and deepening our understanding of it.<br><br>
       Guide to browse through the Map and Charts:<br><br>
       To utilize the interactive map, select the view you prefer.
        With just one click on the menu in the top right corner of the map,
        switch between street view and topography. Beneath these options,
        explore areas across the US that witnessed partial solar eclipses,
        as well as the path of the total solar eclipse. Discover more details
        about cities, states, and the duration of the total solar eclipse by
        clicking on each darker blue circle within the total eclipse path on the map.
       Additionally, you'll find informative charts on this page. Hover
        over each chart to gain further insights.<br><br>
       Missed the eclipse on April 8th? No problem! We've got you covered with a
        bonus video, courtesy of NASA. Find it below the charts and immerse
        yourself in or relive the experience.

    <h2>Average Duration by State</h2>
    <p>Each state was analyzed for its average length of time
        where the totality of the eclipse was visible. As you
        zoom in on the map you will notice that the size of the
        markers are larger in the center of the path of totality
        and smaller at the perimeter which illustrates how the
        length of time where totality was visible longer occurred
        nearer the center of the path of totality. As you can see
        from the bar chart, Michigan had the shortest average of
        totality since only 3 cities in the southwest corner of the
        state were in the path of totality. The average for the state
        was 39 seconds of totality with Lambertville, MI having the
        greatest length of time (1 minute) of viewable total eclipse.
        It was hypothesized that the southern states would have longer
        times of totality since they are closer to the equator but it
        has been determined that the factor influencing longer times of
        totality were states having the most cities within the center of
        the path of totality.</p>
